In 1991, the store was renamed Coles Supermarket and changed its name to Coles since 1998. And in September 2011, Coles began to sell its own brand of clothing in its own stores, while some stores were refurbished to fit the range.\n",

However, the strategies the company makes to expand the business of Coles seems not to affect. Figure 1 is the histogram of total Australian grocery market shares in 2017 and 2018. The diagram shows that the market shares of Coles decreased by 1.6 percent in 2018 compared with its market share in 2017.

The result shows that Woolworths seems to be the preferred supermarket. Existing product recommendation methods in Coles only include some advertisements online, leaflets and promotional emails.

Using sensors, IoT, virtual reality, augmented reality, and wearable technology will not only provide consumers with a more convenient and fast shopping experience but also find more in-depth consumption for retailers' insights based on AI data analysis behind various new technologies. Moreover, machine learning could also personalized product recommendations based on each customer's uniqueness and purchasing propensity. Retailers will be able to analyze consumer behavior and actions as consumers enter the store, helping consumers find the right products and the right offers. Through video analytics, retailers will be able to analyze whether a consumer is viewing an item, or even a part of a package, whether it's price, function or image.

The transformation of retailing has begun due to the rapid development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. US retailer supply chain operations using data and data analytics have seen operating margins increased by 19% over the past five years. Use data analytics in pricing, categorization and placement optimization could help improve merchandise sales by 16%. Applying machine learning technology is the general trend worldwide, especially in the UK.  Retailers have been able to collect a large amount of transaction data and behavioral data from customers. Also, as data volumes and processing power increase, machine learning has become more widely used in the retail industry. Moreover, it further optimizing business processes and driving more influential personalized, contextual consumer experiences and products."
